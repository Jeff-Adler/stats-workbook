## Statistics

- In statistics, variance measures variability from the average or mean. It is calculated by taking the differences between each number in the data set and the mean, then squaring the differences to make them positive, and finally dividing the sum of the squares by the number of values in the data set.

- The p-values of our results will likely drop as the absolute value of r increases. Let’s say our p-value = .04; we can communicate our result like this: the probability of seeing a result like this or more extreme given there really is no relationship between running and cholesterol is 4%. When our p-value drops below a critical value—usually .05—we can reject our null and accept our alternative hypothesis.
in other words: the greater the correlation (= r-value), the more likely it is that the results cannot be explained by chance (measured by p-vale)

- Anscombe’s Quartet is a group of four data sets that serve as a canonical example of where statistical metrics like mean and variance don’t tell the whole story. It also enforces the value of data visualization and the benefits to plotting our data in addition to quantified analysis.
-- Basically: its four data sets with entirely different distributions of data, but the same (deceptive) slope
